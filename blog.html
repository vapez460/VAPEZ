          <h2>Understanding Vape Pods</h2>
          <p>Vape pods are the newest generation of vaping devices. Also called pod systems, pod vapes, and pod mods, these devices are extremely easy to use and maintain. Features such as lower-powered pulls and higher nicotine strengths come together to form a highly portable and super satisfying vape system. Especially if you are a smoker looking to break the habit and switch to vaping but aren’t sure what type of e-cigarette will be most suitable, give a pod system a try. A device such as the ePuffer XPOD delivers an experience that’s surprisingly similar to smoking in terms of throat hit, simplicity, and satisfaction.</p>
          <h3>The benefits of pod systems</h3>
          <p>" As mentioned, vape pods are great for transitioning smokers. That’s partly because when you draw on your vape pod, you’ll use a direct-to-lung type of inhale, just as you would with a traditional cigarette."</p>
          <p>In addition, vape pods are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Discreet and easy to use. The higher PG content of the e-liquid used in a vape pod means less vapour and a subtler vaping experience. These devices won’t produce massive clouds, so they work well for stealth vaping and are quite popular even with experienced vapers who didn’t recently quit smoking.</li>
            <li>Mess-free. Vape pods don’t really have a tank, so to speak, so refilling is easier and cleaner, and they won’t leak the way an advanced vape mod can. If your system uses pre-filled pods, refilling it is as simple as removing and discarding the empty pod and replacing it with a new one. Even if you have a refillable device, it’s going to be easy to fill and highly leak resistant.</li>
            <li>Intuitive to use. Vape pods are foolproof. Either they will have a single button that you click to turn the device on and off, or they are draw-activated. A draw-activated model such as the XPOD senses airflow and fires once you inhale from the mouthpiece. This action results in fewer steps for you and a more authentic “smoking” experience, if that’s important to you.</li>
            <li>Ideal for stowing in your pocket. Because they aren’t likely to leak, vape pods are suitable to stash in your pocket as you go about your day. These compact devices also take up very little space, unlike larger mods, which can be difficult to fit into a typical pocket (and heavy, too).</li>
            <li>Long-lasting. Vaping technology has improved by leaps and bounds in the past several years. Even small devices often feature larger batteries that can keep you happily vaping all day without recharging. You can also refill a blank pod several times before having to replace it with a new one.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Closed vs open systems</h2>
          <p>There are two basic types of pod systems: closed (pre-filled) and open (refillable). Your choice will depend on certain factors, such as your vaping habits and your personal preference.</p>
          <h3>Closed pod systems:</h3>
          <p>Close pod systems come pre-filled with nicotine salts e-juice. This option is ideal for heavier smokers who smoked around a pack a day or more. That’s because nicsalts provide a nearly instant nicotine hit (like smoking) with a pleasant flavour and a smooth, mild throat hit. They’re also the most convenient choice – when you’re done with a pod, simply take it out, discard it, and pop a fresh one in.</p>
          <h3>Open pod systems:</h3>
          <p>Open kits give you the freedom to fill them with just about vape juice you like. They’re best suited to higher-PG liquids, which provide more flavour and a stronger throat hit. Being able to choose your own e-liquid also means that you can choose the nicotine strength you want. If you like the idea of an open pod system but were a heavy smoker, you can still use them – just choose a nicsalt e-juice.</p>
          <p>In general, a closed pod system is more convenient to use while an open system is more cost-effective. This is a personal choice, and there’s no wrong answer. Feel free to experiment – try a closed system and, when you’re ready to play with more options, switch to a refillable kit. In no time, you’ll find what you love and be vaping like a pro.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t that long ago that vapers had very limited options when it came to buying e-liquid for their electronic cigarettes. Unless you were into modding or DIY, your choices were mainly either cartridges meant for cigalikes and a few e-liquids – mostly high-PG products.</p>

                <h1>Choosing the Right Vape Juice</h1>
                <p>It wasn’t that long ago that vapers had very limited options when it came to buying e-liquid for their electronic cigarettes. Unless you were into modding or DIY, your choices were mainly either cartridges meant for cigalikes and a few e-liquids – mostly high-PG products. Today, however, the options are endless. You can choose between high PG and high VG, nicotine salts and freebase, and more – and that doesn’t even touch on the extremely wide array of flavours you can try. In many ways, this variety is a good thing, as it helps make vaping a truly personalised experience that you can design to suit your own unique preferences. However, it can also make buying e-juice confusing for someone who is just starting out. Let’s take a look at the different types of vape juice and how you can determine which ones are right for you.</p>
                <h2>Key terms</h2>
                <p>In the world of vaping, it helps if you understand a few key terms that you’ll hear on occasion. If you’re trying to find the right e-liquid, you may encounter terms such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Nicotine salts: This refers to a form of e-juice made with the salts naturally present in tobacco leaves to provide a smoother throat hit. Freebase liquid, on the other hand, refers to e-liquid without these nicotine salts.</li>
                  <li>Hybrid e-liquids: These juices contain both nicotine salts and freebase nicotine.</li>
                  <li>PG: Propylene Glycol. Used in e-liquid, PG is thinner than VG and provides a stronger throat hit.</li>
                  <li>VG: Vegetable Glycerin. VG is thicker than PG, creates a smoother throat hit, and is slightly sweeter.</li>
                  <li>MTL: Mouth to lung. MTL refers to a method of vaping that involves drawing vapour into the mouth and holding it there briefly before inhaling it into the lungs.</li>
                  <li>DTL: Direct to lung. DTL means that you inhale the vapour directly into the lungs (without holding it in the mouth first).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Choosing your nicotine strength</h2>
                <p>Whether you are using a simple e-cigarette or an advanced vape mod, you’ll need to find the right nicotine strength for you. The trick here is that if you choose a nicotine level that’s too low, you aren’t likely to find vaping satisfying enough and are less likely to switch from smoking successfully. Choose a juice with too much nicotine, and you may experience the unpleasant symptoms of nicotine overload (nausea, increased heart rate, headache, or dizziness). Here’s a good rule of thumb:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you smoke 15-20 cigarettes or more a day: Heavier smokers may want to look for e-liquids with more nicotine (up to 2% or more). That way, you’ll be more likely to truly satisfy your cravings, even without cigarettes.</li>
                  <li>If you smoke less or prefer light cigarettes: Lighter smokers can usually choose lower nicotine content e-juice (0.6% to 1.2%). In general, it’s a good idea to start lower and increase if needed.</li></u1></ul>
                    <p>Keep in mind that you can always switch to a different nicotine level if the first one you try doesn’t work for you.</p>
                    <h3>More considerations</h3>
                    <p>Once you’ve decided on a nicotine strength to try, there are many other choices to make and factors to consider to find the right vape juice for you. Here are some tips to help you get started.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>E-liquid for a strong throat hit.</strong> If you are accustomed to smoking cigarettes, then you may actually enjoy the harshness at the back of the throat – many people do. Look for a higher-PG e-juice, which will better re-create the throat hit you may miss when you quit smoking.</li>
                      <li><strong>E-liquid for a smoother throat hit.</strong> If the harsh throat hit is a turn-off for you, you have a couple of options. First, choose nicotine salts, which both smooth out the throat hit and deliver nicotine faster. Second, you could look for a higher-VG juice, although these are more popular with vapers who use more advanced equipment and want bigger, more voluminous clouds of vapour.</li>

<li><strong>E-liquid for cigalikes.</strong> If you want your vape cigarette experience to more closely mimic the experience of smoking a traditional cigarette, there are two options. Again, a higher-PG liquid will provide a stronger throat hit more similar to that of a cigarette. Also, you can look for a pod system, such as the ePuffer XPOD, which use a blend of nicotine salts and regular e-juice for a very realistic smoking experience.</li>

</ul>
<h3>A word about flavour</h3>
<p>When you shop for your first bottle of e-liquid, you’ll quickly discover an entire world of possibilities. Your choice of flavour is a very personal one, and the best way to find your favourites is to simply experiment. The main thing is to decide whether you’d like a tobacco or menthol flavour or something totally different, such as a fruity or dessert flavour. Again, though, the best way to find what you like is to try it. In fact, many people find that one of the most fun parts of vaping is trying new e-juices, so don’t be surprised if you end up with a rather large collection of options that you enjoy.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, a lot goes into choosing your vape juice. However, once you learn a little about the various factors and identify your unique needs, it becomes much easier to narrow down your best options. Have fun exploring the wonderful and widely varied world of e-liquids!</p>

            <p>Many people would like to quit smoking but have found that it can be easier said than done.

                <h1>Your Guide to Switching from Smoking to Vaping – and Succeeding</h1>
                <p>Many people would like to quit smoking but have found that it can be easier said than done. Most smokers have tried to kick the habit in the past and failed, maybe numerous times, before successfully quitting. E-cigarettes can help ease the transition if you’d like to give up tobacco products but still enjoy the routine, or if you want to move away from smoke and tar without giving up nicotine. Of course, there’s no guarantee that starting vaping will mean you’ll finally quit smoking for good, but countless vapers will tell you that it certainly helped them, and with a little knowledge and a few tips, it may be able to help you, too.</p>
                <h2>Making the switch from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes</h2>
                <p>The debate around whether ecigs can help you quit smoking rages on. However, there is growing evidence that vaping can be successful in luring people away from tobacco cigarettes. People who replace cigarettes with an alternative such as ecigarettes may be more successful in quitting than people who don’t. The experience of vaping is very similar to that of traditional smoking, making it easier to give up even a long-time habit for many people.</p>
                <p>If you’re new to vaping, you’ll find that switching isn’t without its challenges. You’ll be choosing a new product and unfamiliar equipment, and the act of vaping itself is slightly different than smoking, but these challenges are easily overcome. In no time, you’ll be vaping like a pro – and best of all, you’ll be leaving behind a habit that’s unarguably harmful to your health.</p>
                <h2>Choosing the right vape</h2>
                <p>Half the battle when it comes to vaping for a beginner is finding the right vape cigarette. Here are a few pointers.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Buy a quality ecigarette. There are so many ecigs on the market that it can be a little overwhelming to try to narrow it down to the right one for you. Some of these products are better for new vapers, such as disposable ecigs or vape pod starter kits. Avoid making your choice based on price alone – a very cheap or low-quality e-cigarette won’t deliver the satisfying hit that you need to kick your smoking habit.</li>
                  <li>Don’t choose a complicated vape mod. If you want to successfully integrate vaping into your life, it’s probably best to stick to the basics at first. Simpler products such as cigalikes and pod systems can help you get comfortable with vaping first, before moving on to more advanced mods (if you even want to at all). Some mods can get quite complicated – and frustrating for someone who isn’t familiar with how they work and all the accessories and maintenance involved.</li>
                  <li>Try out different types of e-liquid. There are literally hundreds of flavours of e-juice out there. Go ahead and try several of them. Go for an assortment of flavours and nicotine strengths, both to find your favourites and simply to have some variety on hand. Do consider the types of flavours you are most likely to enjoy, whether you generally go for basics like tobacco and mint or are more interested in some of the wilder flavours, such as Caramel Mocha Latte or Banana Vanilla Blast.</li></ul>
                  <h1>Get the most out of your new vape</h1>
	<p>Once you have chosen a good beginner vaping device and have a selection of tempting e-liquid on hand, it’s time to start vaping. Here are a few tips to help you make the switch from smoking and get the most out of your new activity.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make the switch gradually. For many people, the best way to switch from smoking to vaping is to do it slowly. For example, you might start by replacing one of your daily cigarettes with a vaping session. After a few days (or when you feel comfortable), replace another one. You don’t need to feel rushed but do push yourself to take the next steps so that you reach your goal of quitting completely.</li>
		<li>Learn to vape properly. Drawing on a vape is a little different than drawing on a cigarette. Instead of hard, quick puffs, try a longer, softer inhale. Think of vaping as something to be enjoyed and savoured – that’s why there are so many different kinds of e-juice and so much different equipment to explore. Many people find that vaping becomes a highly enjoyable hobby, even one that easily replaces tobacco.</li>
		<li>Get involved with the vaping community. There are vapers just like you all over the Internet and even in your own city. Social media sites offer hundreds of pages that provide a community for vapers. Talk with other vapers, ask questions, read other vapers’ experiences, and learn all you can. You can also look for vaping events and meetups in your area to further your knowledge and meet fellow vapers.</li>
		<li>Avoid vaping constantly. It takes just a few minutes to smoke a cigarette, and then you put it out. Vaping isn’t quite the same. A prefilled disposable e-cig or a tank full of juice can last for some time, allowing constant vaping. However, it’s best to avoid this temptation. You can have an experience that’s more like smoking by limiting yourself to specific time frames in which you will vape.</li></ul>
		<p>Above all, be patient. Switching from smoking to vaping is a big change, and learning how to vape properly won’t happen overnight. Take your time, try new things, and enjoy the experience. When you find what works for you, you’ll quickly discover that vaping can be every bit as satisfying and enjoyable as smoking.</p>

                <p>If you are a new vaper, then you might have found yourself disappointed with your early experiences. This is a common problem that people run into, usually because they are used to smoking traditional cigarettes and try to approach their vapes the same way. In fact, learning how to vape is an art form – but not rocket science. Here are some easy tips to get you started the right way.</p>
                <h2>Choosing the right vape</h2>
                <p>If you are brand-new to vaping, the first thing you need to know is how to use your vape. It’s best to start out simple with a device that’s designed for ease of use, portability, and efficiency. However, “simple” in vaping terms definitely doesn’t mean “inferior.” You can find very high-quality and affordable beginner vapes that will make it easy to get started and provide an excellent vaping experience. You will probably want an e-cigarette, a disposable e-cigarette, or a disposable or refillable pod system so that you won’t have to worry about a lot of complicated maintenance, especially while you’re learning.</p>
                
                <h2>Choosing your e-liquid</h2>
                <p>It can be a process to pick out the right e-juice for you. There are lots of choices to make, including PG vs VG, nicotine strength, and of course flavour (the fun part!). In general, higher-PG liquids provide stronger, more intense flavour and more powerful hits, while higher-VG options are great for people who want big, massive vapour clouds upon exhaling. No matter what, the best way to find the right vape juice for you is to experiment. Buy a few different types of juice (or a few different flavours if you’re buying disposable devices) and try them out. Once you’ve found the right combination of factors, your vaping experience will improve by leaps and bounds.</p>
                
                <h2>How to hit a vape</h2>
                <p>One mistake that many ex-smokers make when starting out with vapes is taking drags that are too short. This technique works fine with cigarettes, but when you do it with a vape, there isn’t time for enough liquid to pass across the heating element. Be patient and take a longer, slower drag, and you’ll enjoy a more satisfying session. There are two main techniques for how to inhale:</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Mouth-to-lung. This type of inhaling is suitable for smaller vapes with more nicotine. It’s very similar to smoking a cigarette. You’ll draw vapour slowly into your mouth, hold it in your mouth for a couple of seconds, and then breathe it into your lungs. Once the vapour enters your lungs, exhale. This method is perfect for people who want to replace smoking with vaping.</li>
                  <li>Direct-to-lung. For a smoother hit, try the direct-to-lung method using a larger device with less nicotine. This is a simpler way to inhale that involves only drawing the vapour quickly and directly into your lungs, much like the action you would take to take a deep breath. Then, exhale the vapour right away.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>It’s a good idea to wait a few minutes between vaping sessions to allow your heating element to cool down and also to prevent problems such as an irritated throat. If you’re looking for a better alternative to smoking, you’ve come to the right place – and now you know how to

        <h2>How Much Nicotine Is In A Cigarette?</h2>

            <p>Many smokers wonder how much nicotine is in a cigarette, especially when they decide to try vaping instead and want to translate the amount of nicotine they’re getting from smoking into an equivalent amount when they vape.</p>
            <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleVisibility('more5');">Read More</a></p>
              <div id="more5" style="display: none;">
                <h1>How Much Nicotine Is In A Cigarette?</h1>
                <p>Although the primary reason that most people smoke is as a delivery system for nicotine, there isn’t a wealth of understanding or information around how much nicotine is in a cigarette.  Nicotine is a complicated and rather interesting topic, especially when you consider how demonised this substance has become by the general public (never mind the fact that cigarettes actually contain a wide variety of worse toxins, including ammonia, tar, carbon monoxide, and many others). It’s true that nicotine is incredibly addictive (often cited as being as addictive as cocaine or heroin), but it’s also true that nicotine does not pose any known significant threat to your physical health.</p>
                <p>Many smokers wonder how much nicotine is in a cigarette, especially when they decide to try vaping instead and want to translate the amount of nicotine they’re getting from smoking into an equivalent amount when they vape. However, this is a question without a clear answer, partly because cigarette manufacturers generally have various options with different amounts of nicotine. Your favourite cigarette may contain anywhere from 7mg to 15mg of nicotine – but that’s not the number that matters, anyway.</p>
                <p>The real question is not how much nicotine a cigarette contains, but rather how much of that nicotine you’re actually consuming. You exhale a large portion of this nicotine after you inhale, for starters. Also, a lot of it simply burns away between puffs. On top of that, you take more or fewer puffs of each cigarette and hold your hits in for more or less time than the next person. That means that, again, we will arrive at an imperfect average, but we can still make an educated guess.</p>
                <p>On average, you probably consume somewhere around 1mg of nicotine per cigarette that you smoke. It may not seem like much, but it’s more than enough to satisfy your craving. Of course, this number varies from person to person and from cigarette brand to cigarette brand.</p>
                <p>As mentioned, not everyone absorbs nicotine at the same rate or in the same way. Even if everyone did absorb nicotine at the same rate, its effects would still be different for different people – for example, the same amount of nicotine might affect a smaller person differently than a larger person, an older person differently than a younger person, or a healthy person differently than a person with certain health conditions.</p>
                <p>All of these factors make it easy to see why it’s so hard to determine how much nicotine you absorb when you smoke. However, we can use what we do know to give you a starting point for choosing the right vape juice for you, as that’s likely why you’re trying to figure out nicotine amounts. In general, if you smoke more than a pack a day, look for an e-liquid that contains around 2.4% nicotine; if you smoke less, 1.2% should do the trick.</p>
